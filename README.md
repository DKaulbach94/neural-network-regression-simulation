# neural-network-regression-simulation

This simulation was part of my master thesis.
By using the function Simulation() you can simulate a regression by a neural network
with different hyperparameters.
The main goal in this project was to understand the path which is taken in the high dimensional
parameter space of the neural network during the learning process.
